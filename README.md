## Look Ma, No Transpiler!

AJScript, as a language, is a strict subset of ECMAScript that can be used fearlessly without a transpiler.

## Write Correct, Safe Programs

AJScript also provides a small set of syntax-compatible additions to the "standard library" that are necessary to write correct, safe programs (things like `RegExp._escape(str)` and `Promise._parallel(qty, arr, fn)`).

We follow [The Zen of Python](https://github.com/ewjoachim/zen-of-python) and [Go Proverbs](https://github.com/BeyondCodeBootcamp/go-proverbs/), in summary:
- [x] Less is More
- [x] Readability above all else
- [x] Designing code that spans across time and developers
